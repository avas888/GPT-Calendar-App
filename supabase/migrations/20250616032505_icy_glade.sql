  # Fix infinite recursion in user_roles RLS policy

  1. Problem
    - The "Admins can manage all roles" policy creates infinite recursion
    - It queries the same table it's protecting to check admin status
    - This causes the policy to call itself infinitely

  2. Solution
    - Drop the problematic policy
    - Create a simpler policy structure that doesn't create circular dependencies
    - Use a more direct approach for admin access

  3. Changes
    - Remove the recursive admin policy
    - Keep the basic user policies for reading own roles
    - Admins will need to manage roles through direct database access or a different approach
*/

-- Drop the problematic policy that causes infinite recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all roles" ON user_roles;

-- Keep the safe policies that don't cause recursion
-- These policies are already in place and working correctly:
-- - "Users can read own roles" 
-- - "Users can insert own role"

-- For now, we'll rely on the service role key for admin operations
-- This prevents the infinite recursion while maintaining security

-- Add a comment to document this decision
COMMENT ON TABLE user_roles IS 'RLS policies simplified to prevent infinite recursion. Admin operations should use service role key.';
